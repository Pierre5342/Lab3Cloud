- writing a file in the cloud (the worker needs to create on his laptop a csv file - called "results" here - to store the results and then send it to the S3 bucket)
- sending a message with the name of the incoming file to the Client and the name of the resulting file (with the calculations)
- waiting for another message (after one minute)
